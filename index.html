            <p>In the heart of Dhaka, where the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Loud and confused noise">clamorous</span> streets never sleep, lived Rahim, an <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Persisting tirelessly">indefatigable</span> dreamer with an <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Unchanging over time">immutable</span> passion for knowledge. As a <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Beginner or novice">neophyte</span> in the power sector, Rahim often felt out of place among his more experienced peers. Yet, his <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Having knowledge of events before they occur">prescient</span> understanding of renewable energy technologies set him apart.</p>
            
            <p>Rahim's journey began in a small, <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Isolated from or uninterested in different cultures, ideas, or peoples">insular</span> town where opportunities were as scarce as rain in a desert. The <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Scarcity or lack of something">dearth</span> of compassion in his hometown had always troubled him, fueling his desire to make a difference in the world. With an almost <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Fearless; adventurous">intrepid</span> spirit, he left behind the comfort of familiarity to pursue his dreams in the big city.</p>

            <p>One day, news broke of an <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Very old or old-fashioned">archaic</span> temple discovered on the outskirts of the city. The find sent archaeologists into a frenzy, providing an excellent landscape for research. Rahim, ever curious, found himself drawn to the site. The <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="In its original condition; unspoiled">pristine</span> beauty of the ruins reminded him of his childhood visits to Rangamati, evoking a sense of wonder at the world's hidden treasures.</p>
            
            <p>As he stood amidst the ancient stones, Rahim pondered the <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system">arbitrary</span> nature of existence. Like the atheists he had debated in college, he too wondered if our survival on Earth was merely a cosmic accident. Yet, unlike them, he chose to see purpose in the seeming randomness of life.</p>

            <p>Returning to his studies, Rahim dove deeper into the concept of <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="The ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections">brain plasticity</span>. The idea that our brains could change and adapt throughout our lives fascinated him. It reinforced his belief in personal growth and the importance of remaining <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Easily influenced; pliable">malleable</span> in the face of life's challenges.</p>
            
            <p>However, not everyone shared Rahim's enthusiasm for learning. His roommate, Biplob, was known for his <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken seriously">irreverent</span> attitude towards their professors. Rahim often found himself trying to <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Pacify or placate">appease</span> their neighbors when Biplob's late-night antics disturbed the peace. Despite his friend's <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Lazy">indolent</span> approach to life, Rahim remained determined to cultivate <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Strong and healthy; vigorous">robust</span> habits, unaffected by external stimuli.</p>

            <p>As Rahim's expertise grew, so did his awareness of global issues. He learned about international relations, including how the USA had <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Impose a penalty or ban as a punishment">sanctioned</span> Iran for its actions. This knowledge sparked a desire to make a difference on a larger scale.</p>
            
            <p>With <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Diligent in application or pursuit">sedulous</span> effort, Rahim prepared for the GRE, determined to pursue further studies abroad. He avoided filling his personal statement with <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="A remark or statement that has been used too often to be interesting or thoughtful">platitudes</span>, instead focusing on his unique experiences and aspirations. His prescient predictions about the future of renewable energy caught the attention of several prestigious universities.</p>

            <p>As Rahim prepared for his journey abroad, he reflected on his growth. He had learned to <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Feel intense dislike or disgust for">loathe</span> close-mindedness and embrace diversity. He understood that while some people might have <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Serious and unrelenting in manner or attitude">stern</span> or <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Unwilling or refusing to change one's views or to agree about something">intransigent</span> personalities, it was important not to let their <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Evil or harmful in nature or influence">malign</span> influence affect his own path.</p>
            
            <p>With a mix of excitement and trepidation, Rahim embarked on his new adventure. He knew that maintaining a <span class="vocabulary" data-definition="Health-giving; healthy">salubrious</span> lifestyle would be crucial in the face of academic challenges. As he boarded his flight, he smiled, knowing that his journey was far from over. It was, in fact, just beginning.</p>
