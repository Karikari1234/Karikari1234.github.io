        <h1>The Rise and Fall of Empire Tech</h1>
        <div class="story">
            <p>In the bustling tech hub of Silicon Valley, young entrepreneur Alex Chen was making waves. His <span class="tooltip vocab">acumen<span class="tooltiptext">His business acumen at this tender age astonishes everyone.</span></span> in the world of startups was unparalleled, and at just 25, he had founded Empire Tech, a company that promised to revolutionize artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>Alex's approach to business was the <span class="tooltip vocab">antithesis<span class="tooltiptext">Cold is the antithesis of hot.</span></span> of the traditional corporate model. He fostered a relaxed, creative environment where innovation thrived. Many <span class="tooltip vocab">ascribed<span class="tooltiptext">He ascribed his success to his dedication and a gift from God.</span></span> his success to his unconventional methods and relentless drive.</p>

            <p>However, as Empire Tech grew, so did the challenges. Competitors were <span class="tooltip vocab">befuddled<span class="tooltiptext">His rude behavior left them befuddled.</span></span> by the company's rapid rise and began to spread rumors. Alex chose to <span class="tooltip vocab">eschew<span class="tooltiptext">To deliberately avoid using; abstain from.</span></span> public statements, preferring to let the company's work speak for itself.</p>

            <p>The tech world buzzed with <span class="tooltip vocab">esoteric<span class="tooltiptext">The language was so esoteric to others that the secret group managed to communicate with one another without any hint from anyone else.</span></span> theories about Empire Tech's groundbreaking AI algorithms. When questioned by the press, Alex remained <span class="tooltip vocab">evasive<span class="tooltiptext">He gives an evasive answer whenever asked any uncomfortable question.</span></span>, fueling further speculation.</p>

            <p>As Empire Tech prepared for its IPO, disaster struck. A former employee accused the company of data theft. Alex was arrested, but his legal team worked tirelessly to <span class="tooltip vocab">exculpate<span class="tooltiptext">My father was exculpated after being thrown to the jail for six months.</span></span> him. To <span class="tooltip vocab">expedite<span class="tooltiptext">The director tried to expedite the project as much as he could.</span></span> the process, they released evidence proving his innocence.</p>

            <p>Throughout the ordeal, Alex remained <span class="tooltip vocab">fastidious<span class="tooltiptext">Well this word comes so much. Such fastidious punctilious work of art is a wonder for us, such details much wow.</span></span> about the company's operations, ensuring that every detail was perfect. He refused to <span class="tooltip vocab">feign<span class="tooltiptext">Don't feign as if you know nothing.</span></span> ignorance about any aspect of the business.</p>

            <p>As the legal storm raged, Alex noticed his COO, Sarah, giving him <span class="tooltip vocab">furtive<span class="tooltiptext">He gave a furtive look to his crush in the middle of the journey, they blushed.</span></span> glances during meetings. He suspected she might be hiding something but chose to focus on the issues at hand.</p>

            <p>The scandal began to <span class="tooltip vocab">hamper<span class="tooltiptext">Rain hampered our journey.</span></span> Empire Tech's growth. Alex realized that maintaining investor confidence was <span class="tooltip vocab">indispensable<span class="tooltiptext">Water is indispensable for life.</span></span> for the company's survival. He worked tirelessly to rebuild trust.</p>

            <p>Late one night, Alex found Sarah in her office, weeping. She <span class="tooltip vocab">lamented<span class="tooltiptext">She lamented the loss of her father.</span></span> her role in the data theft, confessing that she had been coerced by a rival company. Alex was shocked by her <span class="tooltip vocab">myopic<span class="tooltiptext">A myopic way of living life leads to constant failure.</span></span> decision but understood the pressure she had been under.</p>

            <p>Despite the betrayal, Alex maintained a <span class="tooltip vocab">nonchalant<span class="tooltiptext">Despite the death of her father, her nonchalant demeanour made us surprised.</span></span> demeanor in public, not wanting to show weakness. He refused to be <span class="tooltip vocab">partial<span class="tooltiptext">Don't be partial while choosing from two things. It is injustice on your part.</span></span> in his treatment of Sarah, ensuring she received a fair hearing.</p>

            <p>As the dust settled, Alex found himself in a <span class="tooltip vocab">pensive<span class="tooltiptext">I got into a pensive mood coming back from the trip about life priorities.</span></span> mood, reflecting on the events that had nearly destroyed his company. The experience seemed to <span class="tooltip vocab">portend<span class="tooltiptext">The black cat portends a bad incident to occur.</span></span> a new era for Empire Tech, one of greater transparency and ethical responsibility.</p>

            <p>Alex realized that his <span class="tooltip vocab">provincial<span class="tooltiptext">Rural people are seldom provincial, it is only the experience of living in big cities that give people a wider perspective.</span></span> view of success had blinded him to potential pitfalls. He vowed to broaden his perspective and learn from this experience.</p>

            <p>In the aftermath, Alex gave only <span class="tooltip vocab">rudimentary<span class="tooltiptext">I found his explanations of the incident to be rudimentary, too simple.</span></span> explanations to the press, focusing instead on rebuilding from within. He implemented <span class="tooltip vocab">salutary<span class="tooltiptext">Going to the gym everyday is the salutary thing that I do to myself.</span></span> changes in company policy, prioritizing ethical practices over rapid growth.</p>

            <p>The scandal forced Alex to <span class="tooltip vocab">sever<span class="tooltiptext">Don't sever the ties of kinship among relatives and neighbours.</span></span> ties with several long-time associates implicated in the data theft. Though it pained him, he knew it was necessary for the company's survival.</p>

            <p>As Empire Tech slowly regained its footing, Alex felt <span class="tooltip vocab">slighted<span class="tooltiptext">I feel slighted when Ahnaf calls me out for my incapability in front of my juniors.</span></span> by former allies who now shunned him. He pushed through the pain, focusing on the future.</p>

            <p>The crisis had a <span class="tooltip vocab">somnolent<span class="tooltiptext">The somnolent effect of the teacher's lecture cannot be denied.</span></span> effect on the once-energetic office, but Alex remained <span class="tooltip vocab">stoic<span class="tooltiptext">Despite all the challenges that will come towards me I have to be extremely stoic.</span></span> in the face of adversity. He knew that his unwavering resolve would inspire his team.</p>

            <p>As months passed, Empire Tech's innovative new AI system began to <span class="tooltip vocab">supersede<span class="tooltiptext">Nothing can supersede the love of a mother.</span></span> its competitors' offerings. Alex refrained from <span class="tooltip vocab">touting<span class="tooltiptext">I keep touting the benefits of going to the gym.</span></span> this success, preferring to let the results speak for themselves.</p>

            <p>Though his influence in Silicon Valley had begun to <span class="tooltip vocab">wane<span class="tooltiptext">More time went his power began to wane.</span></span>, Alex found himself strangely at peace. He had weathered the storm and emerged stronger, wiser, and more committed than ever to making a positive impact in the world of technology.</p>
